In my project, all of problems 1, 2, and 3 work as intended and satisfy the requirements of outputting N and E at the right time for number 1 and building a correct gray code circuit for number 2. Also, number 3 shows the correct display values for all the different inputs, always showing the correct value from 0-9. For outside sources from class, I used one kmap charting calculator to help check my answers for every problem for both the kmaps and the resulting equations I wrote. This website is attached here: https://ictlab.kz/extra/Kmap/. I did not use any generative AI as those sources were not useful for the scope of this assignment.
