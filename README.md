In my project, problems 1 and 2 work as intended and satisfy the requirements of outputtin N and E at the right time for number 1 and building a correct gray code circuit for number 2. At this time, my number 3 does not fully work as intended, but is close. Right now, I have the 4 input values of V, W, X, and Y mapped to the 7 segment display, and it is able to represent most of the numbers from 1-9, while the correct input bits are selected. Unfrotunately, I have been struggling to add the fifth input, Z, in order to satisfy all the possibilities of the display and finish off the problem. Outside of this, my number 3 is complete. For outside sources from class, I used one kmap charting calculator to help check my answers for every problem for both the kmaps and the resulting equations I wrote. This website is attached here: https://ictlab.kz/extra/Kmap/. I did not use any generative AI as those sources were not useful for the scope of this assignment.
